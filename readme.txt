Git is a distributed version control system.
Git is free software distributed under the GPL.
Git has a mutable index called stage.
Git tracks changes of files.
An empty street,an empty house,a hole inside my heart.
I'm all alone,and rooms are getting smaller.
I wonder how,i wonder why,i wonder where they are.
The days we had,the songs we sang together.
And oh my love,i'm holding on forever.
Reaching for a love that seems so far~~
